# Rick & Morty

The project fetches a list of characters and displays detailed information.

## Installation
To fetch remote images, I used Swift Package Manager with SDWebImage for SwiftUI. Before running, ensure to fetch SPM libraries. The application deployment target was set to iOS 15.0.

## What did I accomplish?

- The project was written in MVVM architecture.

- Views are written in SwiftUI. I used @ViewBuilder to make the code cleaner.
- I utilized the popular push/pop method for presenting views.
